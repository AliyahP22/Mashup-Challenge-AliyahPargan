<h1>❤️My Pets❤️</h1> <!--Added a heading tag-->
    
<p>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</p>

<h2 style="color:darkblue">❤️Lula❤️</h2><!-- added a heading tag that is the 2nd biggest heading tag-->

<img src="Puppy.jpg" alt="Lulu" width="200"> <!--addedd the image of the puppy and adjusted the width so it won't be too big-->

<p>Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with.  I like to take her to the park.  Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.</p>

<h2 style="color:darkblue">❤️Slowpoke❤️</h2><!-- added a heading tag -->
<img src="Turtle.jpg" alt="Slowpoke" width="200"> <!--addedd the image of the turtle and adjusted the width so it won't be too big-->

<p>Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>

<h2 style="color:darkblue">❤️Hamster❤️</h2><!-- added a heading tag -->
<img src="Fish.jpg" alt="Hamster" width="200"> <!--added the image of the fish and adjusted the width-->

<p>Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
